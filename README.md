# Car-Price-Prediction


## The Problem Statement: 

This Project is Based on the features of the car, we are going to predict the Car Selling_Price which is our Target Variable and also done End to End Implementation and Deployment of Car Price Prediction using python, flask, scikit-Learn, etc. on Heroku cloud platform.


## Description: 

This dataset contains information about used cars listed on www.cardekho.com | Dataset Link

This data can be used for a lot of purposes such as price prediction to exemplify the use of linear regression in Machine Learning.

It contains 301 rows and 8 columns.

The columns in the given dataset are as follows:


1. car_name

    Ex:ritz,swift,fiesta...etc 

2. year 
 
    Manufacturing year of the car. Ex: 2007,2018...etc 

3. selling_price(Dependent Column) 
 
     Present price of the car

4. km_driven 
 
    Number of kilometers the car travelled since manufacture date

5. fuel 

    i.e..Petrol,Diesel& CNG 

6. seller_type
 
    i.e..Dealer, Individual 

7. transmission 
 
    i.e..Manual, Automatic 

8. Owner 
    
    owner name already converted to 0,1,3
